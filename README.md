# 🧠 MrHost.ai Telegram Bot

This is a FastAPI + Telegram bot integration built to support a human-in-the-loop review system for MrHost.ai. It allows a human admin to review AI-generated responses and approve, reject, or customize the reply before sending it to the customer.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts messages from an AI automation system (e.g. n8n)
- Sends AI-generated replies to a Telegram admin for approval
- Supports three admin actions:
  - ✅ Accept (send as-is)
  - ❌ Reject (send nothing)
  - 📝 Custom (admin provides a replacement)
- Notifies n8n via a webhook with the admin’s decision
- Sessions remain active until the admin responds
- Forwards any other Telegram slash commands to a configurable webhook for custom automations
